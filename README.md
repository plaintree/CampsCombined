# CampsCombined

This is the first app that I created with the Udemy course The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022. Huge thanks to the instructor Colt Steele for his clear instruction. Definitely check out his Udemy course.

The project uses version control on Github and CI/CD method on Render (https://render.com/) to make sure every version on main branch pushed will be auto-deployed to the website.

## Main libraries used in this project

1. Bootstrap
2. Ejs
3. Express
4. Mongodb
5. Mongoose
6. Nodes
